      <h1>Over The Summer Of 2024</h1>
      <p>
        Over this past summer, I didn't do much, but I enjoyed every small thing
        that I did do.

            I went to my first furry convention in Columbus shortly before the
            end of the school year. I met a lot of new people and had the best
            time. I will return next year.

          <h3 id="fourth">Fourth of July</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>As is tradition in my family, we all went up to my grandparents cottage in Michigan for a week to enjoy the firework display that the rich people set off. There weren't many fireworks that I saw, but we still had a lot of fun on the water.</p>

          <h3 id="bsod">Computer Coma</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>One night, I was playing Sea Of Thieves with some friends when my computer decided to do what I lovingly call the "Syrup freeze", named for my Discord name and the fact that I'm the only one who experiences a periodic 15-30s complete freeze of the game for no discernible reason. This particular freeze took about 1 minute to resolve, and did so by crashing my computer completely. When it rebooted, it would not leave the advanced startup options menu built into Windows, and I was eventually forced to wipe most of my data after 3 days of non-stop struggling with it.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This summer was a welcome break from the monotony of schoolwork. It gave me exactly the amount of time I needed to prepare for the final year of school.</p>
